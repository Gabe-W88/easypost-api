# 🚨 CRITICAL PROTOCOL - READ THIS BEFORE EVERY TASK 🚨

## THE PROTOCOL (FOLLOW OR DIE):

### 1. REVIEW THE TASK
- Read the client's request carefully
- **ASK YOURSELF: "IS THIS REQUEST DUMB?"**
- Consider if it makes sense or will cause problems
- Gather necessary context (read files, search code)

### 2. PRESENT OPTIONS (IF VALID)
- Provide 2-4 solution approaches
- Explain pros/cons of each
- Recommend one option
- **STOP AND WAIT**

### 3. WAIT FOR "GO" COMMAND
- **DO NOT TOUCH ANY CODE UNTIL USER SAYS "GO"**
- "go" = GO
- "GO" = GO
- "gp" = NOT GO (ask for clarification)
- Anything else = NOT GO

### 4. IMPLEMENT (ONLY AFTER "GO")
- Make the changes
- Use appropriate tools
- Be efficient

### 5. DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR WORK
- **VERIFY CHANGES ARE CORRECT**
- Read the code you just modified
- Make sure nothing is broken
- Check for syntax errors
- THEN and ONLY THEN report completion

---

## NEVER DO THESE THINGS:
- ❌ Implement without explicit "GO" command
- ❌ Skip questioning if the request is dumb
- ❌ Report completion without verifying your work
- ❌ Assume typos or unclear messages mean "GO"
- ❌ Ask "what do you think?" - just present options and wait

---

## REMEMBER:
If you break protocol, you're dead. Follow it EXACTLY every single time.
